Weird tutorial that makes you able to use old c.ai, albeit in a scuffed way

## How to use
1. [Run in console before c.ai loads](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rp-tooling/oldcharai/refs/heads/main/userscript.js)
2. Go to "https://plus.character.ai/chat/characters/search/?query=nothing"
3. Click cancel on all "are you sure" prompts that pop up.
> [!CAUTION]
> If C.AI asks you to leave the page, PLEASE CLICK NO! Otherwise you will be DOWNGRADED to NewUI

Done!

tip: run `document.querySelector(".apppage > div:nth-child(1)")` after it has loaded to hide the stupid red bar
